This is a fork of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=208
(it has newer version by original authors then the one in vim-scripts/ctx-1.15 repo)

It aims to improve the plugin to newer versions of Vim and newer languages

CTX is an attempt to help Vim users navigate in C
program files with very large function definitions. Such
files should generally not exist, but alas they do, and
sometimes we need to make changes to them.

This script helps by opening a small window in your Vim
session and keeping up-to-date with a few lines of text
describing your cursor&#039s current scope or context in a C
file.
